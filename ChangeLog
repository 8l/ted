4.4d:
  - sum a rectangular block (single vertical column of numbers) : Press 'C-='
  - You can now use environment variable in string of tedrc.
    Example:
      1. In 'tedrc'
         f [f1]  RaiseOrLoad("$TEDDIR/ted.help")
           If TEDDIR is defined in shell environment variable, ted will use
           it; otherwise it is the same as the TEDDIR in Makefile.
           ( tedrc.tmpl is no longer needed )
      2. You can now define
         f [pause]	ExportStatus("$DBGSTOP %f:%y")
         If the current os is Solaris
             setenv DBGSTOP 'stop at'   in .cshrc
         If the current os is Linux
             setenv DBGSTOP 'b'   in .cshrc
       (Actually this is not needed, if gcc is used, 'b' is set as default)
     3. To prevent ted from interpreting the variable, use '\$variable'

  - You can use [C-F11] to do complex 'grep' and filter and use select bar to
    goto to the line you want to see.
     Example: Looking for any assignment to a variable
        1. Pressing [C-F11] will show a dialogue box with 'Execute Command'
        2. Input 'grep -n 'vname.*=' *.[ch] | grep -v == | grep -v !='
        3. Use currsor keys to select, Esc to escape, Enter to go to that file.
  - accecpt Ctrl-Delete/Shift-Delete in edit line diaglogue box
  - Press 'F12' to put 'stop at %f:%y' in X paste buffer. This is for 'dbx'.
    You may want to change it to 'b  %f:%y' if you use 'gdb'.

    In 'tedrc' :
      f [escape]  left(); SwitchKeyDef(1)
      LoadKeyDefInto "tedrc.vi" 1
    #    load 'tedrc.vi' into def # 1
